<h1>Comic Control</h1>
<p>My aim with this fork is to make an attempt at refactoring, do some general bug fixes, and to update Comic Control to PHP 8. I also want to add a few simple features that I feel would be beneficial and useful to others, and are things that I've added to my personal build of this same project.</p>
<p>I'm a new developer and combing through Comic Control is ultimately what taught me PHP.</p>
<p>Comic Control is absolutely fantastic and I deeply appreciate the work Erin put into it. Thank you for putting it out there for free.</p>

<h2><em>I would advise against using this fork for the moment.</em></h2>
<p>It's still loaded with bugs.</p>

<h2>What are your plans?</h2>
<p>I'm glad you asked!</p>
<p>After all the bugs are squashed, I have a good handful of things I'm excited to integrate into this project, including:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A bookmarking system.</li>
  <li>A cast module.</li>
  <li>An Open Graph image creator for social media.</li>
  <li>Additional templates and corresponding CSS for those who can draw but can't write markup or styling.</li>
  <li>A global toggle switch for content warnings (so if you don't need or want them, they're optional.)
  <ul><li>Additionally, I would like to integrate the already existing tagging functionality into this, so if there's something specific that bugs you and that's also been tagged for, you'll still get a warning for that even if the artist hasn't marked that page with a warning and you have warnings in general turned off.</li></ul></li>
  <li>The ability to easily customize the look of the website per comic page via special effects (for if you like to code and you also like theming!)</li>
  <li>More stuff that I cannot remember right now.</li>
</ul>
<p>A lot of these things are features that have already been implemented either in full or in part into my personal build of this project. My own build has a lot of things baked into it that are specifically just for me and what I want, so this fork is intended as a more general purpose version of that.</p>
