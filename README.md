<h1>Comic Control</h1>
<p>My aim with this fork is to make an attempt at refactoring, do some general bug fixes, and to update Comic Control to PHP 8. I also want to add a few simple features that I feel would be benificial and useful to others, and are things that I've added to my personal build of this same project.</p>
<p><strong><em>I would advise against using this fork for the moment.</em></strong>
  <br>It's still absolutely loaded with bugs.</p>
<p>I'm a new developer and combing through Comic Control is ultimately what taught me PHP.</p>
<p>Comic Control is absolutely fantastic and I deeply appreciate the work Erin put into it. Thank you for putting it out there for free.</p>
